/*Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer
value and that uses a loop to validate the input. The
program should then use a second loop to compute the sum
of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For
example, if the user enters 20, the loop will find the sum of
1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + â€¦ + 20.*/
