// Write a program to find a baseball playerâ€™s batting average.The program should ask the user to enter the number of
// times the player was at bat and the number of hits earned.Display the batting average as a decimal between .000 and
// 1.000. For example,
//if a player bats 40 times and gets 10 hits, which is 25 % of the time, their batting average would be .250.
